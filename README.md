# Job_Salary_Regression
Using Web Scraping and Linear Regression To Determine If Location Affects The Desired Job Salary

This Project Is Broken Into 4 Parts:
1. Collecting The Data
2. Cleaning The Data
3. Analyzing Data
4. Visualizing & Reporting Findings


1. Collecting Data
The Data is Collected From 'SimplyHired.com' which is an online job board similar to ZipRecruiter, Indeed, and FlexJobs.
To Collect the Data Im Using Python and Selenium on a Mac (But This Will Also Work On A Windows Operating System)
Once the Code is Ran, The 'Input' Prompt Will Ask The User For The Desired Position and Which Cities They Are Interested In To Compare
Selenium Will Search The Desired Position in The Desired Cities, and Only Pull Data From The Job Listings That Have Salary Data Listed
